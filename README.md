I am just trying to create a client to communicate multiple users.

## Milestones
Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
Add support for nicknames.
Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he/she presses enter.
Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
Show who’s online.
Add private messaging.
